- Installing JupyterHub
  - Will find config if it is located in /etc/
    - !! remember this, the LTI authenticator may need to be imported here !!
  - note: hub already has a proxy.
  - configuration
    https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/config-basics.html
    - Or by placing the following lines in a configuration file, jupyterhub_config.py:
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
      c.JupyterHub.ip = '192.168.1.2'
      c.JupyterHub.port = 443
      c.JupyterHub.cookie_secret = bytes.fromhex('64 CHAR HEX STRING')
      #+END_SRC
      
- Spawner
  - https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/spawners-basics.html#spawners-and-single-user-notebook-servers
  - TODO deep dive
    - KubeSpawner
  
- Configure the idle culler to run as a Hub-Managed Service
  - https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/services-basics.html#configure-the-idle-culler-to-run-as-a-hub-managed-service
  - this is where the docker suspend feature might work to retain the
    interpreter state of users, instead of wiping their slates
    everytime they idle out.

- How do people share notebooks?
  - "JupyterHub has a special URL that does exactly this! Itâ€™s called /hub/user-redirect/...."
  - https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/faq.html    
  - JupyterHub v2+ also has a feature called "copy shareable link",
    that should do the same.
    
- Supports up to 10,000 users.
